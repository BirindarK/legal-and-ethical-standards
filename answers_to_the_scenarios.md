### Scenario 1

BankingCorp are one of the leading retail banks in the country, offering a full range of products including current accounts, savings products, credit cards and loans. They have in-depth knowledge of their customers' income, financial commitments and spending habits. They already offer some products where customers can pay a monthly fee and receive benefits in return. Some of these benefits include special offers from a curated list of third-party partners which customers can opt-in to receiving.

They have recently been approached by a payday loan company who want to send direct marketing to users struggling to pay their credit card bills. The loan company want to email the customers they feel would be most likely to use their services but acknowledge that manually identifying targets would be time-consuming and want to develop an algorithm to automate this. BankingCorp have given them access to their systems to test this algorithm, ensuring it works with real customer data. The loan company have had some negative publicity recently and so BankingCorp will not be announcing this new partnership publicly. Instead they will inform customers in an email explaining the changes to their terms and conditions.

#### Is the company breaking any laws with their proposal?
BankingCorp is breaking data protection laws, such as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) laws, since they are allowing the payday loan company (third party) to access private consumer data. 

They are also violating the regulations guiding unsolicited marketing communications since they are sending marketing emails for the third party financial products,  under the guise of changes in their terms and conditons, to unconsenting consumers. 

They have also violated fair lending laws as the third party partnership spefically targets consumers who struggling with paying their credit card bills and excludes any other consumer.

#### What are the ethical concerns with the company's proposal?
The targeting of consumers that struggle to pay their credit card bills would potentially cause them to end up in a cycle of debt and increase their financial difficulties if they choose to take up the offer from the payday loan company.

In partnering with the payday loan company without the consumers' knowledge BankingCorp lacks transparency and violates the trust between the consumers. Since the third party access to the consumers data, they can then use that data to target those consumers with harmful financial products without their consent.

Furthermore, the trust between BankingCorp and their consumers would be further ruined since BankingCorp knowingly partnered up with a payday loan company that has a negative reputation, thus ruining their credibility as retailing banking company.

#### What could the company do to address these issues?
Firstly, BankingCorp should explicity gain consent from consumers before sharing their data with any third-party that wants to use that data for marketing reasons.

Secondly, BankingCorp should enhance their transparency with their consumers by clearly communicating any changes to terms and conditions to consumers, including any partnerships they engage in with third-parties. 

Finally, they should reconsider their partnership with the payday loan company, and only take on partnerships with third party companies that align with BankCorp's values and commitments and also provide benefits to BankCorp's consumers without exploiting their finanacial positions. 


### Scenario 2

The new mobile game Treasure Hunters has been taking the country by storm. Players are shown an illustrated map and must find the hidden treasure by following clues and solving puzzles. The quicker a player finds the treasure the more points they score and they can compare their scores with their friends. Five new maps are added every day and each map can be completed in a few minutes, with the low time commitment making the game a huge hit with casual players. There are many players who would like more puzzles, though.

The developers have been taken aback by the success of the game and are struggling to keep up with demand. They have had to spin up more servers and are looking to hire more engineers to keep working on content. That costs money though, and they are looking to monetise the game. Instead of adding new maps daily they will continually be adding more which players can unlock by completing existing maps. Players will be able to spend their points to unlock hints which will help them progress faster. Hints will also be available to purchase using real-world money, with the possibility of offering multi-buy discounts at a later date.

#### Is the company breaking any laws with their proposal?
Legally, the company is currently not breaking any laws with their proposal.

However, following the implementation of their proposal they need to consider consumer protection laws, data protection regulations, and advertisement regulations to protect new and future consumers. 


#### What are the ethical concerns with the company's proposal?
The monetization of the game introduces an unfair advantages to users who are able to afford the in-game purchases, as it allows those users to progress faster in the game over those who can't afford the in-game purchases.

The purchase of hints using real-world money can introduce users to gambling habits since it can attract players to consistently pay for hints to progress further in the game. 

The monetization of the game and the constant updates to the game to add new features that players can unlock through in-game purchases could potentially lead to addictive behaviours. 

#### What could the company do to address these issues?
Firstly, the company can ensure that the monetization of the game does not give those who can afford in-game purchases unfair advantages over those who cannot, however, still maintain value to the user. For example, paying for a new outfit for the game characters.

Secondly, the company can implement responsible gaming practices, such as limiting in-game purchases and reminders to take breaks, to prevent the negative impact of excessive gaming for users. 

Finally, engaging with users by asking for user feedback and concerns about the games monetization strategies, and be open to making adjustments based on user preferences and ethical considerations.

### Scenario 3

`friends.com` is a new match-making service to help people socialise when they move to a new area. Users enter their area and a list of their interests before being shown a list of people with similar interests in the area. There's no guarantee of an exact match in interests and the suggested friend could be on the opposite side of the city. Users can freely view each others' profiles and message each other, but the matching service will speed up the process of making new contacts. The site is free with revenue coming from generic banner ads on the page.

Their development plans involve adding a premium membership which will lock many of the existing features behind a paywall. Free users will only be able to view limited versions of profiles and have a daily cap on the number of matches which can be made. Premium users, on the other hand, will now have more specific location settings and be able to filter their matches. To advertise the premium service the free-tier users will be given occasional "trial periods" of the premium tier followed by adverts showing them what they could unlock by subscribing. Additionally the generic banner ads will be replaced by more targeted advertising for local businesses. Users' location data will be shared in order to ensure relevant businesses are being advertised.
